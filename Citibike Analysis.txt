Citibike Analysis

The data set used was for a 12 month from 12/2019 to 11/2020.

One of the observations we made was the top 10 stations for the year were all in the Jersey City area. In addition to that 5 of the top 10
stations were all major public transit areas. This suggests that biking could be a popular option to get to and from stations near public transit.

Another intersting insight we discovered was usage preference when comparing monthly pass users to 24hr pass users is that monthly users
prefer to go for shorter rides usually under 20 mins, while 24hr pass users tend to ride for 25 mins or more.

We also charted overall rider activity and as expected around march rider activity did take a hit as lockdowns happened around the nation.
Also in the warmer months we did see ridership climb to it's peak in September. Although suprisingly at the time of lowest rider activity
rider duration was at it's peak with female riders leading the way. 

Looking further into gender stats female riders on average went for longer riders than male riders. One of the driving forces behind this potentially
could be that the majority of the female riders are in the youngest age group which could be part of the reason they are riding for longer times.

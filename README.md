# Citibike_Analysis

In this analysis 12 months of data was pulled from the Citibike website. We then used VBA to aggregate the files into a master file and then import into Tableau where further analysis was completed. Created two dashboards looking at the top 10 most popular stations and rider activity broken down by gender..

###### Top 10 Stations

One of the observations we made was the top 10 stations for the year were all in the Jersey City area. In addition to that 5 of the top 10
stations were all major public transit areas. This suggests that biking could be a popular option to get to and from stations near public transit.

Another intersting insight we discovered was usage preference when comparing monthly pass users to 24hr pass users is that monthly users
prefer to go for shorter rides usually under 20 mins, while 24hr pass users tend to ride for 25 mins or more.

###### Demographics

Looking further into gender stats female riders on average went for longer riders than male riders. One of the driving forces behind this potentially could be that the majority of the female riders are in the youngest age group which could be part of the reason they are riding for longer times.
